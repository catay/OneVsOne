# BZFlag OneVsOne plug-in

## Introduction

The OneVsOne plug-in is a bzfs plug-in specially created for one of the
finest BZFlag leagues:

**[Zongo's 1vs1 BZFlag league](http://1vs1.bzflag.net)**

The plug-in enhances player vs player gameplay in BZFlag, allows in-game 
communication with the league site and provides real-time match reporting.

The plug-in was initially heavily based on a bzfs 1vs1 patch from BZFlag 
developer Pimpinella. During the years a lot of extra features were added 
to make the league/game more attractive.

The plug-in does NOT contain any 1vs1 league site specific code which 
interacts with the plug-in. 
That code is independenlty  developed by strayer ([BZBB profile](https://forums.bzflag.org/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=227)).

To use the full feature set of the plug-in the league code is mandatory.
It is ofcourse always possible to write this from scratch.

## Requirements

No extra libraries are necessary to get it compiled, it all uses standard stuff.

The plug-in is compatible with the latest stable BZFLag release (2.4.x).

## Compilation & Installation

Check out the [BZFlag Wiki article](https://wiki.bzflag.org/Plug-ins#For_versions_on_or_after_2.4.3)
on how to build third-party plug-ins.

Get the latest BZFlag source code from GitHub.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:BZFlag-Dev/bzflag.git
```

Clone the latest OneVsOne plug-in source code below the BZFlag plugins directory.

```bash
$ cd bzflag/plugins
$ git clone git@github.com:catay/OneVsOne.git
$ cd ..
```

**Optionally**, apply the 'fancy' patch to the BZFlag source tree.
Make sure you are in the root of the source tree.

```bash
$ patch -p1 < plugins/OneVsOne/misc/fancy-2.4.patch
```

Configure and build BZFlag server and custom plug-in.

```bash
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --disable-client --enable-custom-plugins=OneVsOne
$ make
```

If the build is succesfull the plug-in can be found under:

```bash
$ ls -l plugins/OneVsOne/.libs/OneVsOne.so
```

## Plug-in command Line

The plug-in takes a ini based configuration file as a parameter.  In
case no INI file is provided it falls back to basic mode and all the 
1vs1 league integration code is deactivated.

```
-loadplugin PLUGINNAME[,<path to INI file>]
```

Example:
 
```
-loadplugin /myplug-indir/OneVsOne.so,/myconfigdir/ovso.ini
```
  
## The INI file

A little more info about the plug-in and the ini configuration file.

Example BZFlag server and plug-in INI configuration files for different styles can be found in the examples directory.

 * [classic style](https://github.com/catay/OneVsOne/tree/maint/examples/classic)
 * [fancy](https://github.com/catay/OneVsOne/tree/maint/examples/fancy)
 * [hix style](https://github.com/catay/OneVsOne/tree/maint/examples/hix)

The main purpose of the ini file is to allow custom configuration settings.

A INI configuration file has 4 sections which each hold different parameters
and values :

**[general]**

The general section contains the most obvious config settings.

| key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| max_lives | The life count each player has. For the 1vs1 league this has to be set to 10. |
| style | Which style gets reported to the 1vs1 league site after an official match was played. |
| compatibility | Is a flag that when true still allows the use of the `/official` command. Mainly to stay compatible with the old version and to not annoy players. The `/official` command got superseded by the command `/ovso match official`. |

**[commands]**

It is possible to define your own 'match' commands like this :

| key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| slash command name| Keyword name that will be send to the league site and log. |

Example:
```
  official = official
  contest = contest2009
```
  
For now we only need 'official'. After an official match the keyword also wil 
be send to the 1vs1 league site. That way we know what kind of match was 
played.  When there is a new contest for example , we can add a contest command
with different keyword and distinguish that way what kind of match it was.

To issue a match, we use the in-game `/ovso match <command>`.

**[communication]**

This part mainly deals with plug-in and 1vs1 league site communication.

| key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| httpuri| Is the URI at which the plug-in communicates with the 1vs1 league site. All communication happens over HTTP. |
| enable_motd| When set to true the motd at the 1vs1 league site will be displayed when a player joins. It is also possible the change the motd from within the game if you have the OVSO_CFG permission set. This is possible with `/ovso motd set <message>`. |
| enable_welcome| When set to true the welcome message set at the 1vs1 league site will be displayed when a player joins.  Both the motd & welcome message make centralized management possible from league site. It ensures that welcome messages across 1vs1 are all the same. We don't have to annoy server owners when we want to change them. |
| refresh_interval| The interval at which the plug-in will refresh his cached version of the welcome and motd message. The default is 3600 seconds and ONLY when there is a player on the server. |

**[logging]**

The logging section deals with the configuration of the log path.

| key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| logfile| Path to the log file that stores the results of the played matches. |

The logfile will store all the official played matches. The plug-in will send
the scores and a lot more of info to the league site in realtime. When this
fails , it is handy to have a backup system in place. If we store the info 
also to file we can later mail it to the league site. The mail will be 
automatically processed and checks will occuer to see if the match already was recorded.

In the scripts directory the script
[report_matches.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catay/OneVsOne/master/scripts/report_matches.sh) 
is provided which can be placed in crontab to mail on a daily basis the match
reports.

## In-game commands

The OneVsOne plug-in provides the following in-game commands.
Commands with (!) are not avaible in basic mode (without INI file).

Display the plug-in version.

```
/ovso version
```

Lists a brief help section about all the available actions.

```
/ovso help [<action>]
```

Declare a match of a certain match type. Executed without the match
type parameter it provides an overview of the available types. (!)

```
/ovso match [<match type>]  
```

A player can subscribe to the 1vs1 league with this action.    
A mail with activation link will be send to the e-mail address. (!)

```
/ovso register <emailaddress> 
```

Queries the 1vs1 league site and displays in-game the player(s) league info. (!)

```
/ovso playerinfo <callsign> [<callsign> ...] 
```

Queries the 1vs1 league site and displays the monthly player ranking.
The amount of items to return can be provided, default is 20. (!) 

```
/ovso topscore [<items>]
```

Queries the 1vs1 league site and displays the players zelo ranking.
The amount of items to return can be provided, default is 20. (!)

```
/ovso topzelo [<items>]
```

Update the Message Of The Day on the 1vs1 league site.
This requires the OVSO_CFG permission in the groupdb file. (!)

```
/ovso motd <get>|<set [message]>
```

Set/get the maximum life count.
This requires the OVSO_CFG permission in the groupdb file.

```
/ovso lives <get>|<set [life count]>
```

## Other features

**superkill**

Players are also able to use the /superkill command. 
Using /superkill is not possible (even not by an admin/cop) when
an official/... match is in progress or when a player himself declared 
a match.

**recording**

All the official/... matches are also recorded. For recording you 
have to specify the -recdir <dirname> in your bzfs config file otherwise 
recording won't work.

Also don't put the -recbuf option in your config file, recording won't 
work if you do.

The recording is named as follows : 

```
winner[score]_loser[score]_yyyymmdd_hhmmss.bzr
```

Example:

```
Koziol[10]_karlik25[9]_20060827_123456.bzr
```

**scores logged to debug level 2**

All the scores of official/... matches is also logged by bzfs at debug level 2.

Search for the pattern "DEBUG::OneVsOne PLUGIN:: SCORES" .

## Todo

* The plug-in probably doesn't work like it should when load/unloading it 
  manually.

* Let the plug-in generate the random worlds.

* Make sure the plug-in handles it well when bzfs config allows more 
  then 2 users. Now you have to make sure your bzfs config is correct.
  It is possible to let the plug-in handle this.

* No idea if the code builds on Windows. 
  This code was only tested on Linux.

* Suppress the error message for the Welcome & Motd message when the
  league site is not reachable. (Add a disableError(bool) method to
  the URL handler class)

* A lot of other stuff I forget.
